# pl0-compiler-project

A university compiler project based around the [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) teaching language (which
itself is modeled on Pascal.) The scope of this project included only the lexical and syntactical analyzers.

This project is mostly "as-is" - i.e. it remains in the format in which it was created many years ago. Small changes
have been made for readability and convenience.
